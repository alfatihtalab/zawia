/// Confirmation dialogs give users the ability to provide final
/// confirmation of a choice before committing to it,
/// so they have a chance to change their minds if necessary.
//
// If the user confirms a choice, it’s carried out. Otherwise,
// the user can dismiss the dialog. For example,
// users can listen to multiple ringtones but only make
// a final selection upon tapping “OK.”
